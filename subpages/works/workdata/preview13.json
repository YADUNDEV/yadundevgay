  "description":"A prototype capable of modifying a characters meshes, bones, and materials before serializing and de-serializing that information to and from XML. Models such as clothing or body parts can be swapped with other parts and are subsequently re-rigged, bones can be manipulated and scaled, and colors can be changed. There is also framework for texture swapping. All of this data is saved into a XML document averaging about 5000 lines which is later parsed through on load.",
