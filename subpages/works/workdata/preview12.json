  "description":"Attached is a few of the audio files produced for the Josiah Lebowitz's upcoming visual novel Aurora's Nightmare. Produced between 5/29 to 6/20, I was brought on to help finish the audio work for the title. I was given 40 prompts and worked with Audacity and Mixcraft 7 to produce roughly 375 audio files (including alternate and revised sounds) in response, utilizing both stock and original recordings.",
