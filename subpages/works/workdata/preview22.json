    "description":"CIS SEAD Academy is a WebGL based social, emotional, and academic development evaluation tool and game designed for primary school students. Developed for and in association with Communities in Schools, the game utilizes a server-less API to submit, receive, and manage data points via AWS DynamoDB, and AWS Cognito for user accounts.\nIn the game itself, students progress through a series of 7 scenarios designed to record S.E.A.D.-relevant data without passing judgement or attempting to teach S.E.A.D. concepts.",
